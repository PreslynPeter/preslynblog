            <p>The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. “ Genesis 2:15</p>
            <p>During this quarantine period we are all looking of ways to get to our nearby gardens or parks. We are thrilled to hear the birds chirping near our window sill, Indeed God created world and placed us stewards to take care of nature. However greed and mismanagement has left us with a polluted habitat.

            <p>During this quarantine period we are all looking of ways to get to our nearby gardens or parks. We are thrilled to hear the birds chirping near our window sill, Indeed God created world and placed us stewards to take care of nature. However greed and mismanagement has left us with a polluted habitat.
            </p>
            <p>According to a study conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation. “The rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares per year between 2015 and 2020. The area of primary forest worldwide has decreased by over 80 million hectares since 1990.</p>
            <p>As of December 2019, a total of 20 334 tree species had been included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2019a), of which 8 056 were assessed as globally threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable). More than 1,400 tree species are assessed as critically endangered and in urgent need of conservation action.”</p>
        <p>We are all aware of saying “rainforests are the lungs of the earth”. Imagine if this forest area continues diminishes we might be forced to walk around with oxygen suits like astronauts.</p>
    <p>Therefore practice of planting trees especially in urban areas would be the greatest gift to our future.</p>    
<p>We all enjoy excursions by the sea or even a waterfall. 
    But how many of us know the harm done to these water bodies. Due to oil spills and improper waste disposals methods we are loosing marine life. Most importantly fresh water pollution has rapidly reduced the availability of clean drinking water around the world. According to the United Nations, “water use has grown at more than twice the rate of population increase in the last century. By 2025, an estimated 1.8 billion people will live in areas plagued by water scarcity, with two-thirds of the world’s population living in water-stressed regions as a result of use, growth, and climate change.”</p>    
<p>Another great threat to our environment is the constant emission of pollutants both into the water bodies and the atmosphere. Over production the result of industrial revolution has led too much waste accumulation as well. Resources are used carelessly and seldom with an effort to conserve. These pollutants have caused the extinction of many species. Gave rise to respiratory diseases such as asthma.

</p>
<p>The above mentioned issues have become the reason for vast wildlife extinction. Their habitats have been destroyed by man-made fires. Improper dumping of wastes into landfills and especially in seas have put whales into endangered category. This huge damage seems impossible to repair, however, we have seen good signs of improvement in air quality just 3 months of lockdown. When the whole world stayed indoors. Pollution and contamination was kept at bay. Greatest testimony for the same is seen by the reduction of Co2 levels in or nation’s capital. According to a study conducted by the IIT (Delhi.) In Delhi, the country’s most polluted city, transport contributes to pollution by 41 percent, industry contributes 18.61 percent, power 4.92 percent and residential emissions 2.96 percent. The capital city has witnessed 87.9 percent decline in nitrogen oxide, whose main contributor is transport. The study states that amid lockdown, “Delhi observed the maximum reduction of 49 percent in AQI  
    This reduction in AQI was also associated with a change in dominant pollutants in many cities.</p>
<p>Technological development needs to keep biosphere protection in mind. From development to its disposal .Every step should help nature and not harm. 
    For technology that poisons nature would inevitably bring harm to all mankind.</p>
<p>All things big start out with small and steady efforts. Let us join hands to protect nature. Together we can save our environment for the future.</p>

            <p>Once on my trip to my paternal grandfather’s village as usual we passed by many tress and farmlands. However, there came about a big banyan tree. This was also not a special sight. The enormous structure seemed to be overwhelming. Those big branches and hanging roots seemed to form welcome arch for our entry. It was a pleasant site to enter under that caring shade of trees.

                Definitely this was over many hundreds years old even 1000 perhaps. Owing especially to its massiveness and majestic setting. Surely this tree has seen many of our forefathers we thought. From the time it had been planted it would have definitely seen many days in history that we faintly know. Behold the tree stands there for ages seeing people walk to and fro. Only some being aware of this massive creature. Grateful to God during travel. For they can find shade under its branches.
                
                Seldom have we failed to realize that these trees have constantly been there for our well being. Especially that this tree has seen both the good and generous side of man as well as cruel heartless exploiters. The trees are there for our good. The more they are present the more healthy and happy we will be.
                
                Trees not only provide fresh air and increase the water table. They are home to many small creations. Haven to those nestlings and small beings. Particularly Banyan Trees with its huge branches provide a cool shelter for every passer-by. Definitely that is why perhaps it is the perfect meditation site. A tiny arena marked by roots. A place of solace and harmony you wouldn’t want to lose. Helping all the intense pressures of the word take a step back. And help you concentrate on the countless blessings provided by God in his abundant grace and mercy.
                
                God’s divine grace and mercy is what keeps us going. Well, otherwise we could find ourselves stuck in real worse situations forever. Since our Lord is watching over us we are safe. God has declared that he cares for us. More than many sparrows is our worth is what Jesus has told us in the Bible. Therefore we need not fear. Just continue looking up to God our maker.</p>
            <p>Sometimes feel the eyes of the Tree still look at us lovingly. Hoping we would come back to enjoy its embrace. For throughout the years our dependency has decreased. To keep it alive is no longer man’s vital priority. Man so focused on immediate gains. That he deliberately grabs resources that belong to their descendants. Trees are felled extensively and we fail to replace them with new samplings. Just grow some little apartment plants and substitute that duty.

                However the Tree stands in the same place with undeterred majesty. Though we live our lives of diabolical selfishness. Still generously continues to provide us with its goodness. We may not seem deserving of such a kindness. Because like traitors we who loved it in the start have begun to turn a blind eye to its aching heart.
                
                This ordeal has promoted me to understand my creator more clearly. We followed Christ in our initial days of salvation. As days passed in His abundant grace we seemed to have forgotten His unconditional love and goodness. Our minds are now occupied with the pleasures of this world. That destroy us as well as our future generations. We seldom seem to realize that it was God who can give us the ultimate prosperity. And we foolishly go behind the joys that are short lived. Very shortly finding ourselves in a predicament.
                
                We need to remember that for while we were still sinner Christ died for us. He is still alive interceding for us. Coming to our help in our tough times. Lifting us up when we fall and answering our every call. He never pushes us away when we come to Him. Like a Father He always waits for us to return to His loving arms.
